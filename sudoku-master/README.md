# Sudoku

A solver for the classic puzzle, as a programming 
project in python. 

The project has two phases.  In the first phase 
I implemented constraint propagation to solve simple 
puzzles. In the second phase I added back-tracking
search to solve harder puzzles. 

It uses a model-view-controller organization to 
associate a graphical display with the game.
